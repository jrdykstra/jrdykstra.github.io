    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm [Your Name], an Econometric Consultant with a focus on data science within litigation contexts. I have experience in SAS and Python and am currently pursuing a Masters in Applied Data Science from the University of Chicago. Professionally, I'm driven by a passion for coding, data science, and providing for my family. As a Christian, my faith guides me in my personal and professional pursuits.
    </p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>
      Beyond my professional life, I'm a fan of fantasy genres including Zelda, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. I also enjoy dark-souls-like video games. When I'm not lost in a fantasy world, you might find me playing sports like pickleball, basketball, or various yard games. I also appreciate a good sitcom and some of my favorites are Seinfeld, New Girl, Brooklyn 99, and Modern Family.
